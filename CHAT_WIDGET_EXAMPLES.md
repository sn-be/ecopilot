## 📋 Example Conversation Flow

```
User: Hi, I just saw my carbon footprint report. Where should I start?

Bot: 🌱 Great question! Looking at your data, your largest emission source is Electricity at 12,450 kg CO2e (45.2%). I'd recommend starting there for maximum impact. Would you like specific suggestions for reducing your electricity emissions?

User: Yes, what can I do about electricity?

Bot: Based on your footprint, here are three high-impact actions:
1. LED Lighting Upgrade - Could reduce electricity by 20-30%
2. Programmable Thermostats - Save 10-15% on HVAC
3. Energy Audit - Identify specific inefficiencies

Your second-largest source is Transportation at 8,200 kg CO2e (29.8%). Should we explore that next?

User: How much would LED lighting cost?

Bot: For a typical business your size, LED retrofitting costs $2,000-5,000 but pays back in 1-2 years through energy savings. Plus, you'd reduce your electricity emissions by approximately 2,500-3,700 kg CO2e annually. Would you like me to explain the calculation?

User: What about my waste emissions?

Bot: Your waste accounts for 2,100 kg CO2e (7.6%) - relatively small but still addressable! The main opportunities are:
- Implement recycling program
- Reduce single-use items
- Compost organic waste

These are typically low-cost or even cost-saving initiatives. Interested in specific steps?
